##Finding Statistcis You Can Trust##

Finding software and determine whether that software is trustworthy or not is hardest.

**Biostars** 

is one support site where you can ask  about all sorts of bioinformatic or genomic software, not juest package.

You can ask information about how to do specific analysis, also in general, what's the right packages to use for a particular analysis and get some feedback from the community.

**Bioconductor**

adds some additional checks onto software. This is exclusively R packages, but those R packages have to not only run, but they have a minimal level of peer review that somebody das looked it over, make sure it does somethings different, has maybe even tried it out and see if it works.

**CRAN** 

is now exclusively our packages that you can find there.

**GitHub** 
sometimes you find very trustworthy software on Github. Usually you have to judge by the person that has created it, whether you  think that they migh produce good software in the future, which can be a little bit dicey some times.
